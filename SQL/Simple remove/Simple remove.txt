To remove rows from a table in SQL, you use the DELETE statement. The basic syntax is:

sql
Copy
Edit
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
Example:
If you have a table called users and you want to remove a user with id = 3, you can do:

sql
Copy
Edit
DELETE FROM users
WHERE id = 3;
Deleting Multiple Rows:
You can delete multiple rows by specifying a condition:

sql
Copy
Edit
DELETE FROM users
WHERE email LIKE '%example.com';
(This will delete all users with an email ending in @example.com.)

Deleting All Rows (⚠️ Dangerous!):
If you want to delete all rows from a table but keep the table structure, be very careful—running this will remove everything:

sql
Copy
Edit
DELETE FROM users;
A safer way to do this is:

sql
Copy
Edit
DELETE FROM users WHERE 1=1;
Completely Reset a Table:
If you want to remove all rows and reset auto-increment counters, use TRUNCATE:

sql
Copy
Edit
TRUNCATE TABLE users;
⚠️ TRUNCATE is faster than DELETE, but it cannot be rolled back in most databases.
